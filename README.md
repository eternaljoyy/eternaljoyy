### Hi there 👋

 I'm a Software Developer, with a deep interest in:
 
 - OS
 - Computer Architecture
 - Networking
 - Compilers

 (And am also a curious tourist in the following): 

 - Distributed Systems
 - Security 
  

Currently I'm working on some cool things, which include: 
 
- 🔭 working on doing data structures and algorithms puzzles
- 🌱 learning C++
- Reading about Computer Architecture 


When I'm not doing anything CS related, you catch me reading a cool webtoon, watching a cute k-drama, or playing with my dog 🐶.
